# 0013. Usecase-Adapter Dependency Inversion

**Date:** 2026-03-05
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The usecase layer directly imported the session layer to call infrastructure functions
(session runners, scan recording, store factories, state loading). This created a tight
coupling: usecase depended on concrete session implementations rather than abstractions.

The hexagonal architecture principle (port-adapter pattern) requires that inner layers
depend only on interfaces, not on outer-layer implementations. The cmd layer should act
as the composition root, wiring concrete session implementations to usecase-defined
output port interfaces.

Prior to this change, the dependency graph was:

```
cmd → usecase → session (direct import)
```

This violated the Dependency Inversion Principle: high-level policy (usecase) depended
on low-level detail (session infrastructure).

## Decision

Invert the usecase→session dependency using output port interfaces:

1. **usecase depends only on `usecase/port` interfaces** — no session import allowed.
2. **session implements port interfaces** as adapter structs (e.g., `SessionRunnerAdapter`, `ScanRunnerAdapter`).
3. **cmd acts as composition root** — creates session adapters and injects them into usecase functions.
4. **Pure passthrough functions eliminated** — usecase functions that only delegated to session are deleted; cmd calls session directly.

Post-inversion dependency graph:

```
cmd → usecase      (business logic invocation)
cmd → session      (composition root wiring)
cmd → usecase/port (type references)
usecase → usecase/port (output port interfaces only)
session → usecase/port (adapter implementation)
```

Enforced by semgrep rule `layer-usecase-no-import-session` (ERROR severity).

### sightjack-specific changes

- 4 new port interfaces: `SessionRunner`, `ScanRunner`, `RecorderFactory`, `StateLoader`
- 4 adapter structs in `session/adapters.go` implementing these interfaces
- 3 usecase functions retained with port parameters (RunSession, ResumeSession, RunScan)
- 14 pure passthrough usecase functions deleted; cmd calls session directly

## Consequences

### Positive
- usecase layer is fully decoupled from infrastructure — testable with null objects
- Dependency direction matches hexagonal architecture intent
- Pure passthrough elimination reduces indirection and code volume (14 functions removed)
- semgrep rule prevents regression

### Negative
- cmd layer has more wiring code (composition root responsibility)
- Port interface additions require coordination between usecase/port and session

### Neutral
- Test files (`*_test.go`) are exempt from the session import prohibition
  to allow integration-style tests that verify adapter behavior
