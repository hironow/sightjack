# 0018. MCP pivot: claude code session owns LLM, sightjack Go CLI is MCP server data plane

**Date:** 2026-05-21
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Starting 2026-06-15, Anthropic Claude Code subscription plans (Pro,
Max 5x, Max 20x) bill `claude -p` and Agent SDK usage against a
separate monthly Agent SDK credit pool ($20 / $100 / $200) that is
disjoint from the interactive usage quota. The previous sightjack
Go CLI architecture invoked `claude --print` as an `exec.Command`
subprocess on every scan / wave-generation / discussion / apply step
via `internal/session/claude_adapter.go`, plus a separate
`claude --print --max-turns 1 "1+1="` health probe in
`internal/session/doctor.go`. Every production run after 2026-06-15
would draw on credit pool capacity that is not sized for autonomous
issue-classification loops.

We surveyed every technically plausible way to keep the existing
control flow running off the interactive quota:

- PTY automation (`creack/pty`, `expect`), tmux `send-keys` +
  `capture-pane`, Remote Control protocol use, and TTY spoofing via
  `script(1)` all violate the Anthropic Acceptable Use Policy clause
  on bypassing product-imposed restrictions, regardless of intent.
- `--output-format`, `--input-format`, `--fallback-model`,
  `--max-budget-usd`, and the rest of the structured-output flag set
  are documented as `--print`-only, so even a successful TTY-spoof
  would still degrade to TUI scraping for any automation-grade
  output.

We also considered keeping the existing Go CLI architecture and
swapping the auth path to a direct Anthropic API key or a third-party
provider (Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry). This works technically but
abandons subscription billing entirely and shifts sightjack to a
per-token cost model with no upper bound, which is the opposite of
the design goal that motivated subscription onboarding.

The refs/issues/0027 plan synthesised these constraints into a single
direction: invert the LLM ownership. paintress Phase 1 (ADR 0017)
established the canonical 9-commit pattern; sightjack Phase 2a
applies the same pattern adapted to the scan / wave / discuss / apply
pipeline.

## Decision

sightjack relinquishes the LLM owner role. From this commit forward,
the architecture is:

1. **Human-initiated claude code interactive session is the LLM
   owner.** All inference happens inside the session's subscription
   quota. No production code path may invoke `claude --print`, import
   the Anthropic Agent SDK, read `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or otherwise
   call the API outside the active session.
2. **sightjack Go CLI exposes an MCP server (`sightjack mcp`).** The
   server speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio and registers tools that
   wrap the existing data plane (event sourcing, scan projections,
   wave planning, D-Mail outbox/inbox, OTel instrumentation). The
   session loads the server via `--mcp-config`. This is distinct from
   the existing `sightjack mcp-config` subcommand, which manages the
   legacy `.mcp.json` consumed by the now-deprecated `claude_adapter`.
3. **A claude code skill drives the workflow.** The
   `/sightjack-scan` slash command (under
   `plugins/sightjack/skills/sightjack-scan/SKILL.md`) is the only
   sanctioned entry point. Hooks may emit human-readable notices on
   stderr but must not auto-trigger LLM calls and must not surface
   inbox payloads on stdout (which the official hooks docs feed into
   the session's context).
4. **D-Mail cross-tool messaging follows the paintress canonical
   schema.** `internal/domain/dmail_envelope.go` is a symmetric
   re-implementation of paintress's canonical 9-field envelope so
   sightjack can decode inbox messages without depending on
   paintress's import graph. The v1 `domain.DMail` (convergence /
   specification flows) coexists during the pivot transition; a
   future ADR (post-MCP-pivot) reconciles them.
5. **A semgrep gate enforces the boundary.** The rule set in
   `.semgrep/jun15-no-headless-llm.yaml` blocks every executable
   path that could re-introduce `claude --print`, the Agent SDK,
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or shell-wrapped variants thereof. `permanent`
   nosemgrep exemptions on this rule are not allowed in production
   paths; the only legitimate exclusion is `tests/**` for the
   fake-claude binary used in test fixtures.

The Go CLI keeps its event sourcing, transactional outbox, OTel
spans, scan projections, and domain language. What it loses is the
right to spawn a subprocess that calls the model.

## Enforcement inventory

### Entry points

- `cmd/sightjack` Cobra subcommands that previously drove inference:
  `scan`, `waves`, `discuss`, `apply`, `nextgen`, `run`.
- `internal/session/claude_adapter.ClaudeAdapter.Run` /
  `RunDetailed` — the unified provider runner that prior to this ADR
  built a prompt, exec'd `claude --print`, parsed stream-json from
  stdout, wired the OTel span emitter and the StreamBus subscriber,
  and persisted raw events to `.run/claude-logs/`.
- `internal/session/doctor.go` — the `claude --print --max-turns 1
  "1+1="` health probe plus the `context-budget` check that read its
  stream output.
- Any future code that wants to call the model from outside an
  interactive session (Agent SDK, GitHub Actions, third-party SDK
  apps).

### Persistent data carried into the new path

- `internal/domain/dmail_envelope.go` (9-field `DMailEnvelope`) pins
  the cross-tool message schema (`message_id`, `source_tool`,
  `target_tool`, `kind`, `body_path`, `created_at`, `seen_at`,
  `ack_at`, `idempotency_key`). The on-disk layout is
  `inbox/<message_id>.yaml` + `inbox/<message_id>.body.md`.
- `sightjack.next_wave` / `sightjack.get_scan_result` /
  `sightjack.update_strictness` MCP tools will expose the existing
  wave projection, scan history, and strictness state as MCP
  resources. Phase 2a ships these as stubs that surface the contract
  descriptor; real wiring lands in a follow-up commit.
- OTel span attributes (`gen_ai.*`, `messaging.*`) continue to flow
  through the MCP server, so the trace topology that previously
  spanned `claude --print` invocations now spans MCP tool calls.

### Bypass candidates

- Direct `exec.Command("claude", "--print", ...)` from Go code —
  blocked by `jun15-no-claude-print-exec-go`.
- Shell wrappers (`bash -lc "claude --print ..."`, `sh -c`, `just`
  recipes, `scripts/*.sh`) — blocked by
  `jun15-no-claude-print-shell-wrapper` and the literal-scan rule.
- Anthropic SDK imports in Go (`github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go`)
  — blocked by `jun15-no-anthropic-sdk-import-go`.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env reads — blocked by
  `jun15-no-anthropic-api-key-read`.
- `SessionStart` / `PreToolUse` hooks that stream inbox content on
  stdout — blocked by the documentation convention (`stderr only`)
  and the `type: prompt` hook prohibition.
- Future `--bare`-mode invocations of `claude` from outside the
  session — covered by the shell-wrapper rule.

### Tests proving coverage

- `internal/session/mcp_server_test.go` — seven tests prove the
  `sightjack mcp` stdio server advertises all four Phase 2a tools
  (`sightjack.ping` + `next_wave` + `get_scan_result` +
  `update_strictness`), dispatches each correctly, and returns the
  JSON-RPC `-32601` error for unknown tools / methods.
- `internal/session/claude_test.go::TestClaudeAdapter_RunDetailedReturnsErrMCPPivotDeprecated`
  — one canonical test proves `ClaudeAdapter.Run` / `RunDetailed`
  return `session.ErrMCPPivotDeprecated` via `errors.Is`.
- `internal/domain/dmail_envelope_test.go` — five tests cover the
  YAML schema (paintress -> sightjack direction), required-field
  validation, idempotency-key dedup, ack semantics, and the
  `inbox/<id>.yaml` + `body.md` file pair.
- `tests/integration/doctor_test.go::TestRunDoctor_ReturnsAllResults`
  — asserts the `claude-inference` and `context-budget` checks now
  return `Skip` with a `(post jun15 MCP pivot, refs/issues/0027)`
  reason.
- `just semgrep` — 78 rules, 0 findings, including the five
  `jun15-no-headless-llm` gate rules with no production-path
  exclusions (only `tests/**` remains for the fake-claude binary).

## Consequences

### Positive

- Subscription billing keeps paying for all sightjack LLM use after
  2026-06-15. Credit pool consumption from sightjack is zero by
  construction.
- The Acceptable Use Policy boundary is honoured: every model call
  is human-initiated inside an interactive session.
- The Go CLI's domain plane (event sourcing, SQLite outbox, OTel,
  scan projections, wave planning, D-Mail semantics) survives intact
  and is now exposed via a stable MCP contract that other tools can
  adopt.
- The semgrep gate makes the boundary mechanical; future contributors
  cannot silently re-introduce headless LLM calls.
- The 9-field `DMailEnvelope` adopted from paintress unifies the
  cross-tool message format across sightjack / paintress and any
  future consumer.

### Negative

- `sightjack scan`, `sightjack run`, `sightjack waves`,
  `sightjack discuss`, `sightjack apply` all flow through
  `ClaudeAdapter`, which now returns `ErrMCPPivotDeprecated`.
  Operators must launch a claude code session and invoke
  `/sightjack-scan` manually. Schedulers and CI jobs that wrapped
  any of these subcommands no longer work without that
  human-in-the-loop step.
- Multi-tool parallel orchestration loses the easy concurrency story
  that came with independent Go processes. A single interactive
  session is the natural unit of work.
- 33 test functions that exercised the legacy `RunDetailed` body
  (claude_adapter args/retry tests, streambus session-end wiring,
  review-gate fix cycle, run-scan streaming, wave-generate partial
  failure, lifecycle / DMail / result-cache integration suites,
  rival-contract producer golden) were retired in sub-B. Phase 2b/c
  and a later MCP wiring commit must reintroduce equivalent coverage
  against the MCP server contract.
- The `claude-inference` and `context-budget` doctor checks no longer
  prove headless inference works. Sub-B for the next phase will
  rewire them to probe the MCP server's `sightjack.ping`-equivalent.

### Neutral

- `ClaudeAdapter` struct fields (`ClaudeCmd`, `Model`, `TimeoutSec`,
  `Logger`, `ToolName`, `StreamBus`, `NewCmd`, `CancelFunc`) are
  retained even though `Run` / `RunDetailed` no longer read them,
  because the composition root (`cmd` package) still constructs the
  adapter and the Phase 2 MCP server tools are expected to reuse
  parts of the wiring (StreamBus, OTel attrs).
- The existing `sightjack mcp-config` subcommand is kept; it manages
  the legacy `.mcp.json` and may be retired once the MCP server path
  is fully wired in a follow-up phase.
- The `tests/fixtures/dmail/dmail-2026-06-01T11-00-00Z-def456.{yaml,body.md}`
  fixture pair carries the paintress → sightjack direction of the
  symmetric 9-field envelope; paintress's `sightjack → paintress`
  fixture covers the inverse direction.
